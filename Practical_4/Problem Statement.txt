Write a program to implement multiple inheritance.

Consider a class BankAccount with
data members as account number, aadhar number, owner name, ROI and balance with
member functions openAccount(), deposit(amount),closeAccount() and
updateInterest() (this method deposits 4% interest to the account). 
Create an interface Debitable which has method withdraw().

Derive a class FixedDepositAccount from BankAccount having data member lockInPeriod. 
Override methods updateInterest() to update Simple Interest, and method closeAccount()
to charge 5 % for closure of FD Account before lockInPeriod.

Derive a class SavingAccount from class BankAccount and interface Debitable.

The account numbers should be serial numbers of  5 digit and
automatically assigned on object creation, such that all FDAccounts 
start with 55 and all Saving account start with 11.

[ROI for Saving Account is 4% and for FD â€“ 1-2yrs-6% ; 2-5yrs-6.5% ; >5yrs- 7%]
