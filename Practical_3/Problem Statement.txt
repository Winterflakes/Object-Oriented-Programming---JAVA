Consider the following scenario:-
A college stores the student information as Name, Gender, Department Name, CGPA.
College also stores the placement details as industry name, annual package and joining letter number.
If the student is going for higher studies then the details are stored as
Degree Name, College Name, Admission Letter Number, Competitive exam details (Name, Score).
If student is going for Entrepreneurship then information stored is Company Name,
