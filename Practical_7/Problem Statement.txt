A.  Design a generic class MyArray with add() , grow() and swap(). 
    add() adds the element to the array at last index.  
    grow() increases the internal size by 1.5 times. 
    grow() should be called within the add() when the size is exhausted.
    Declare grow() as private. 
    swap() swaps elements the array given two indices.


B.  Design an application for maintaining a Student Phone Directory. 
    Student has attributes like roll, name, semester,city, contact, etc. 
    The phone directory will maintain a sorted collection of Student objects 
    based on the semester (and roll number, if semester is same),and have functionality 
    to add Student, remove Student, view city wise Students and view all students. 
    If a student has missing data, then addition of such student should throw a
    user defined exception. 
    Write code to demonstrate the working of all classes.
